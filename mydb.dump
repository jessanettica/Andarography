FILM SYNOPSIS: Dedication, discipline, drive and heart are qualities in all great long distance runners and in all those who reach for the American Dream.¬† They are also at the core of the documentary; City Slickers Can''t Stay With Me.  Framing City Slickers Can''t Stay With Me is the career of Mebrahtom (Meb) Keflezighi, a world class distance runner with a unique American success story.¬† Born during a war of Independence in Eritrea, Meb and his family were forced to flee the war torn country when he was only 10 years old.¬† They eventually settled in San Diego, CA, setting Meb on a path to represent the United States as an Olympic distance runner in 2000, 2004, and 2012.¬† Through Meb, City Slickers Can''t Stay With Me reminds us that great achievements are rarely made on one''s own.¬† Meb''s success story is only half the story.¬† His extraordinary personal and athletic achievements are only part of the legacy of Coach Bob Larsen.  Bob Larsen''s life-long commitment to understanding the sport of distance running has been a key contributing factor in the resurgence of American distance running on the international stage.¬† Larsen''s ability to galvanize the emotional, intellectual and physiological components of his runners has garnered unwavering respect from his athletes, former athletes and his peers and has produced winning teams and star athletes from unlikely circumstances.  Through photos, interviews, and recent footage, City Slickers Can''t Stay With Me provides insights into what has made Coach Bob Larsen such an influential figure in his field and led so many to attribute their success in other areas of life to lessons learned during their time with Coach Larsen.¬† The documentary explores the trajectory of Larsen''s achievements and innovative coaching techniques in an effort to get the best out of his runners.¬† City Slickers Can''t Stay With Me has the capacity to inspire those outside of the field to reach higher and run farther than they may have ever thought possible!

Shoot for Mars. Even if you miss, You‚Äôll land among the Stars. 
This is not the original quote but I changed it to fit my year. I‚Äôm excited that this race is in my honor as E.T. was the first movie I ever saw in a theater! 
¬†I‚Äôm Linda Hodges from Arkansas, a mid 40 something: wife of Jason, mother of 4, Mamaw of 5, Registered Nurse, a horrible Diabetic and a Moon Jogger! (oh and my cousin is Carolyn Guhman who introduced me to y‚Äôall) I proudly went on the maiden voyage to the moon and have been in LOVE with Moon Joggers ever since. I adore your stories, I celebrate your joys, I pray for your burdens- basically I live thru your eyes as my health keeps me from running. 
I ran as a kid, tried out for track in Junior High and made the team (but I was too cool to race back then or so I thought). I had just regained my love for jogging on a treadmill when I dropped 60 lbs in a matter of 8 weeks. It was that symptom that lead to the diagnosis of diabetes. I‚Äôm actually considered a Type 2 diabetic with Type 1 tendencies. In layman terms: my body at times does not produce the insulin it needs and even when it does my body has a ton of problems absorbing it. I lost at the genetics BINGO, my grandparents, my parents, my only brother, and several aunts and uncles ALL diabetics. 
 Due to diabetes I‚Äôve suffered 2 Strokes (2011 &2013), have multiple heart issues now, but the worse is I‚Äôm losing my ability to walk because I can‚Äôt feel my feet and lower legs. I do walk. My tag line is ‚ÄúI wiggle when I walk.‚Äù I ambulate with a cane or walker, however there are more and more days that I must use an electric wheel chair. I continue to get miles; it may take me all week to get one mile or good days I may get 3. My husband and I are quite crafty; I can walk pretty well with a jogging stroller with a cinder block baby, its name is George. I may have diabetes but I refuse to let it steal my joy. This is my story‚Ä¶my personal walk in life.

Jeff''s Story, shared by his friend Kenda. 
Jeffrey Alan Joseph Hill was born December 24, 1983.¬† I met him when he was a just a tiny sweet boy, when my family and his family came together as friends.¬† ¬†¬† 
Jeff was the youngest of three boys.¬† The ultimate little brother.¬† He had an unbelievable amount of energy, was mischievous and full of fun.¬† He had a smile that would light up a room!¬† The years blur together but as Jeff grew older, his energy did not lessen and his smile did not dim.¬† He grew into a wonderful man, brother, uncle and friend.¬† He had a love of knowledge and learning and his desire to absorb information and debate anything and everything exceeded that of anyone I have ever known.¬† He was constantly planning his next move and no one around him ever doubted that he would do great things with his life.¬† He had a profound love for Trinidad (the island), where his mother is from, and visited there as often as possible.¬† He also had abundant love for his family, his many friends, music, finance, economics, politics and the good old Denver Broncos.¬† 
His life made an impression on countless people.¬† He regularly talked about the importance of leading a positive life and tried to spread that attitude to everyone he came into contact with.¬† Notes to Jeff included kind words and great memories: 
‚ÄúYour passion for everything whether it be work, friends, family, or just having a damn good time was so contagious that it drew everyone around you in‚Äù 
 
‚ÄúAlways smiling, always helping, always willing to lend a hand.¬† Jeff, this world is a better place because you were in it‚Äù 
‚ÄúNothing stopped you from achieving your dreams.¬† You were a wealth of information and fascinated by learning.¬† I thought you would never be stopped‚Äù 
Jeff left this place November 6, 2014.¬† We will never know what caused him to take his life.¬† What we hope, is that we can learn and grow from what he has taught us.¬† We also pray that we can somehow help others that may be going through what he went through in the last days, weeks, and months of his life.¬† Jeff always was and continues to be deeply loved by all of his friends and family.¬† We hope to live up to his last wishes and reminders: ‚Äúforgive‚Äù and ‚Äúsmile‚Äù.¬†

You''re never too old to learn to bicycle! Instructors will work one-on-one to teach the basics of balancing, starting, stopping and steering a bike, as well as proper helmet fit and adjustment. Most people learn to ride their bike while taking the class, but even if they don''t, they will leave with tips to continue teaching themselves to ride. 

The first step will be balancing on your bicycle; instructors will first remove the pedals and lower the seat enough so that you can put both feet on the ground. 
You''ll learn balance by taking longer and longer steps until you''re "gliding." 
Then, once you''ve got that down, we''ll show you how to turn confidently and stop smoothly.
Once you feel comfortable, we''ll reinstall the pedals, so you can incorporate pedaling and learning to steer, and how to steer precisely in circles and figure-eights. 
You''ll finish your lesson by learning how to shift gears so you can handle hills and prepare for more city riding.

All courses meet at the Waller Bicycle Learning Area, at Waller Street at Stanyan Street. Please be sure you can sit on your bike seat with both feet flat on the ground.  
Even if you don''t have a bicycle, we will send information on how and where to rent one for the class -- this cost will be covered by you, the participant.

Framing City Slickers Can''t Stay With Me is the career of Mebrahtom (Meb) Keflezighi, a world class distance runner with a unique American success story.¬† Born during a war of Independence in Eritrea, Meb and his family were forced to flee the war torn country when he was only 10 years old.¬† They eventually settled in San Diego, CA, setting Meb on a path to represent the United States as an Olympic distance runner in 2000, 2004, and 2012.¬† Through Meb, City Slickers Can''t Stay With Me reminds us that great achievements are rarely made on one''s own.¬† Meb''s success story is only half the story.¬† His extraordinary personal and athletic achievements are only part of the legacy of Coach Bob Larsen.  Bob Larsen''s life-long commitment to understanding the sport of distance running has been a key contributing factor in the resurgence of American distance running on the international stage.¬† Larsen''s ability to galvanize the emotional, intellectual and physiological components of his runners has garnered unwavering respect from his athletes, former athletes and his peers and has produced winning teams and star athletes from unlikely circumstances.  Through photos, interviews, and recent footage, City Slickers Can''t Stay With Me provides insights into what has made Coach Bob Larsen such an influential figure in his field and led so many to attribute their success in other areas of life to lessons learned during their time with Coach Larsen.¬† The documentary explores the trajectory of Larsen''s achievements and innovative coaching techniques in an effort to get the best out of his runners.¬† City Slickers Can''t Stay With Me has the capacity to inspire those outside of the field to reach higher and run farther than they may have ever thought possible!
